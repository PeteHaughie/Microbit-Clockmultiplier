# Microbit Clock Multiplier

## Howâ€¦

Just upload the hex file to your microbit and you'll see a pattern appear on the LED matrix. 

The pattern on the matrix represents five different rhythmic patterns.

The centre five are the base pulse. The top left is the base pulse duration * 2. The top right is base pulse * 3. The bottom right is * 4, and the bottom left is * 5.

The next steps are to send a pulse out of specific digital pins and take a clock signal in as the base pulse.
